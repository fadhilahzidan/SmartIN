## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to build a face recognition system using a combination of image processing techniques, the FaceNet deep learning model, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). It includes the steps for preprocessing facial images, extracting facial embeddings, training an SVM classifier, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Features
- Detection and extraction of faces from images using MTCNN.
- Utilization of the FaceNet model for generating facial embeddings.
- Training an SVM classifier for face recognition.
- Evaluation of the model's accuracy and performance metrics.
